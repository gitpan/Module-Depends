=over

=item 0.13 Tuesday 26th June, 2007

    File::chdir 0.08 changed its behaviour and is not backwards
    compatible - avoid using it.


=item 0.12 Thursday 1st March, 2007

	Implement a y_n for the Module::Build fakery


=item 0.11 Saturday 3rd February, 2007

	Fixed the emulation of Module::Install::require
	Change the base test case so that it doesn't need a 
        ./Build dist first (for when building out of SVN rather 
       than a released dist)
