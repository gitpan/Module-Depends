What changed over the last 3 revisions

=over

=item 0.11 Saturday 3rd February, 2007

	Fixed the emulation of Module::Install::require
	Change the base test case so that it doesn't need a 
        ./Build dist first (for when building out of SVN rather 
       than a released dist)


=item 0.10 Thursday 2nd June, 2005

	Ship the file for the test suite.  Doh.


=item 0.09 Thursday 2nd June, 2005
